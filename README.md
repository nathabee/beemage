 # <img src="./docs/icon.svg" alt="Icon" width="60" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:20px;"> BeeContour — Extract the main outline

**BeeContour extracts clean contour outlines from images directly in your browser.**
It works best with **high-contrast subjects** such as drawings, silhouettes, winter trees, scanned artwork, or simple photos with clear edges.

BeeContour runs **entirely client-side** and is available both as:

* a **standalone web application**, and
* a **Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)**.

No uploads. No server processing.

## Try it now

You can use BeeContour immediately in your browser:

👉 **[https://nathabee.github.io/beecontour/demo/](https://nathabee.github.io/beecontour/demo/)**

The demo runs the same panel UI as the extension, without requiring any installation or browser permissions.

## What BeeContour does

BeeContour focuses on a single, well-defined task:

> Turning an image into a clean, reusable outline — without uploading it anywhere.

With BeeContour, you can:

* Load an image directly in the browser
* Detect and extract the main contour
* Clean and simplify edges interactively
* Preview intermediate and final results
* Export outlines as raster images or SVG paths
* Experiment visually with parameters to refine the result

The workflow is **manual and visual by design**, favoring understanding and control over automation.

---

## Typical use cases

BeeContour is useful for:

* Preparing outlines for illustration or graphic design
* Extracting silhouettes or line art from photos
* Creating clean bases for coloring or vector work
* Educational and exploratory image processing
* Quick experiments without installing heavy software

It is **not** intended to replace professional image editors or batch vectorization tools.

---

## Privacy

BeeContour is designed to be transparent and review-friendly.

* Runs entirely **locally in the browser**
* No analytics
* No advertising
* No tracking
* No network requests for image processing
