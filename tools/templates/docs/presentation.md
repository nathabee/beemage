**BeeMage extracts the main outline from an image directly in your browser. Works best with high-contrast subjects such as winter trees.**

This project is a Chrome Extension built on **Manifest V3**.  
It is designed as a clean, minimal starting point for building browser extensions with a modern structure and clear separation of concerns.
